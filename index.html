            <p>Hello, I am Kiyah Stokes and I am from Jackson, TN. My goals career wise is to finish my education at the University of Memphis and become a Web Developer. I graduated from Jackson State Community College with an Associate of Science with emphasis on Programming. I am interested in the programming field and have been taking steps toward my career since my sophomore year in high school. Currently, I am attending the University of Memphis as a Senior. My degree plan consists of Computer Science courses with Interactive and Creative Media. My plan is to obtain my bachelor’s degree and pursue a career in programming and web design with decent cyber security knowledge. I have excellent communication skills, patience, and ambition. I also work well with others and during solo projects. Also, I have a passion for the arts such as singing, dancing, and drawing. Hopefully, one day I hope to be owning my own dance studio and community center.</p>
